# Real-Time Collaborative Task Manager

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project is a fully responsive task management web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.  
It simulates **real-time collaboration**, user authentication, and task management using only client-side technologies (via `localStorage`) as per assignment guidelines.
